OD Commander is forked from DinguxCommander which is a file manager for RetroFW.
It uses two vertical panels side by side, one being the source and the other the destination, like many 'commander-style' file managers such as Norton Commander or Midnight Commander.

DinguxCommander allows to:

* Copy, move and delete multiple files.
* View a file
* Execute a file
* Edit a file one line at the time
* Rename a file or directory
* Create a new directory
* Display disk space used by a list of selected files/dirs
* Display disk information (used, available, total)

## Settings

For instance to change the UI/font size on e.g. Steam Deck create a file called commander.cfg in ~/.config/ (also called $HOME/.config/) with these settings in it:

```
disp_autoscale_dpi=0
disp_ppu_x=2.5
disp_ppu_y=2.5
```

You can find other settings in this source file:
